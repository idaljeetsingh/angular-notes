# Operators

In simple terms, Operators are Functions that are available with the RxJS library. RxJS exports functions called
Operators.

There are two types of Operators:

1. [Creation Operators](CreationOperators.md) - Creates new observables
2. [Pipeable Operators](PipeableOperators.md) - These are the functions for handling streams of data. They take an
   observable as an input and
   outputs a new observable.
